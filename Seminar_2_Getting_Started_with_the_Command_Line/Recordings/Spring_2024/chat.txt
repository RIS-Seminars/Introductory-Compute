13:59:25	 From  Elyn Fritz-Waters (she/her) : But if you have the full path of the directory name, you can cd to that directory from any directory you‚Äôre in
14:08:27	 From  yulia : How do I move file in different directory
14:12:26	 From  Elyn Fritz-Waters (she/her) : You can use a command like the following

14:18:25	 From  Alnoor : Does cat command only read csv file format? When I use this command for an excel file, it shows weird characters.
14:21:21	 From  Elyn Fritz-Waters (she/her) : Cat works on human readable text files. A csv is just a comma delimited text file. I am not sure what an xsl(x) file is, but if it is a binary file, it won‚Äôt be considered what is human readable and will give weird characters when you use cat.
14:21:40	 From  yulia : How can I search for two words
